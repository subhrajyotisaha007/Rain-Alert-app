# Rain-Alert-app
this is an automatic Rain-alert system. It will mail you before you leave for work if there's a chance to rain, it will send you a rain alert "please bring umbrella it might rain". I set the time at 8:00 a.m. I can change the time also. I used Python Anywhere to host the code and run it everyday at 8:00 a.m. and I got the rain information from OpenWeather API. Hopefully it can save me from rain ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…ğŸ˜…
